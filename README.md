OOP revolutionized software design by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
The Internet Age and Agile Methodologies (1990s-Present):
The proliferation of the internet and web technologies dramatically changed the landscape of software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that outlines the steps involved in developing software from initial concept to maintenance. While specific models may vary, here's a breakdown of the common phases:

Planning:
This initial phase involves defining the project's scope, goals, and objectives.
It includes feasibility studies, resource allocation, and creating a project plan.
The aim is to establish a clear understanding of what needs to be accomplished.
Requirements Analysis:
In this phase, the team gathers and documents the specific requirements of the software.
This involves understanding user needs, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security).
The output is typically a requirements specification document.
Design:
This phase focuses on creating the software's architecture and design.
It involves designing the user interface, database structure, and overall system architecture.
The goal is to create a blueprint for the development team.
Implementation (Coding):
This is where the actual coding of the software takes place.
Developers write the code based on the design specifications.
Following coding standards and best practices is essential.
Testing:
This crucial phase involves testing the software to identify and fix bugs and ensure it meets the requirements.
Various types of testing are conducted, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
The purpose is to deliver a high-quality, reliable product.
Deployment:
Once testing is complete, the software is deployed to the production environment.
This involves installing and configuring the software for end-users.
Deployment strategies can vary depending on the software and the organization.
Maintenance:
This ongoing phase involves providing support, fixing bugs, and implementing updates and enhancements.
Maintenance ensures that the software remains functional and relevant over time.
This can also include monitoring the software for issues, and security updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology:

Description:
A linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC is completed before the next one begins.   
Emphasis on thorough planning and documentation upfront.   
Changes are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is completed.   
Characteristics:
Rigid structure.   
Predictable process.
Well-defined requirements are essential.
Limited customer involvement during development.   
Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with well-defined, stable requirements.
Projects where changes are unlikely.
Projects with strict regulatory requirements (e.g., government projects).   
Projects where thorough documentation is crucial.
Example: building the software to control the systems of a space shuttle.
Agile Methodology:

Description:
An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration.   
Focus on delivering working software in short iterations (sprints).   
Adaptability to changing requirements.   
Continuous feedback and customer involvement.   
Characteristics:
Flexible and adaptable.   
Iterative development.
Emphasis on collaboration.   
Continuous feedback.
Ability to handle changing requirements.
Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with evolving requirements.
Projects where customer feedback is crucial.
Projects where rapid development is needed.
Projects in dynamic environments.
Example: developing a new mobile app or a web application for an e-commerce platform.   
Key Differences:

Flexibility:
Waterfall: Rigid.   
Agile: Flexible.   
Change Management:
Waterfall: Difficult to accommodate changes.   
Agile: Embraces changes.   
Customer Involvement:
Waterfall: Limited.   
Agile: Continuous.   
Development Process:
Waterfall: Sequential.   
Agile: Iterative.   
Planning:
Waterfall: Extensive upfront planning.   
Agile: Incremental planning.   
In summary, the choice between Waterfall and Agile depends on the specific project requirements and the environment in which it will be developed.
